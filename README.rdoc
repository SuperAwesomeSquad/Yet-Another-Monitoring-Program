== Yet Another Monitoring Program
<p><em>What does it do?</em></p>
<p>A web application monitoring app that takes the complexity out of system monitoring.</p>

<p><em>Why do you want this app?</em></p>
<p>You get a lot of SaaS alerts that donâ€™t actually help you do your job. You only want to be alerted when things are actually in crisis mode.</p>

<p><em>Aren't there othering monitoring apps out there?</em></p>
<p>Yes, there are many apps that provide SaaS services. Think of this as monitoring-lite. We are simplifying the information delivery and promising to alert you to serious, serious failures.</p>

<p><em>How will you get your data?</em></p>
<p>You will give us urls/domains to keep an eye out for.</p>
