== Yet Another Monitoring Program
<em>What does it do?</em>
A web application monitoring app that takes the complexity out of system monitoring.

<em>Why do you want this app?</em>
You get a lot of SaaS alerts that donâ€™t actually help you do your job. You only want to be alerted when things are actually in crisis mode.

<em>Aren't there othering monitoring apps out there?</em>
Yes, there are many apps that provide SaaS services. Think of this as monitoring-lite. We are simplifying the information delivery and promising to alert you to serious, serious failures.

<em>How will you get your data?</em>
You will give us urls/domains to keep an eye out for.
