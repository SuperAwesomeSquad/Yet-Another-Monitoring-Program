= Yet Another Monitoring Program

===What does it do?
A web application monitoring app that takes the complexity out of system monitoring.

===Why do you want this app?
You get a lot of SaaS alerts that donâ€™t actually help you do your job. You only want to be alerted when things are actually in crisis mode.

===Aren't there othering monitoring apps out there?
Yes, there are many apps that provide SaaS services. Think of this as monitoring-lite. We are simplifying the information delivery and promising to alert you to serious, serious failures.

===How will you get your data?
You will give us urls/domains to keep an eye out for.
